The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the specificity of CSS selectors.  The intent is to style all list items, except those within a navigation menu. However, due to the higher specificity of the second rule, it overrides the first, resulting in all list items inheriting the second rule's style. 

```css
li {
  color: blue;
}

nav li {
  color: red;
}
```
