The following solution uses the `:not()` pseudo-class to correctly style list items. The `:not()` selector improves the readability and maintainability of the solution by clearly indicating what items should *not* be styled in a certain way. 

```css
li {
  color: blue;
}

nav li {
  color: red;
}

/* Solution using :not() pseudo-class */
li:not(nav li) {
  color: blue;
}
```
